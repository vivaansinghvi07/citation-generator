# Word Counter
This is a python program built using the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library that approximately counts the number of characters and words on any website!

This works by opening the HTML source of the code, and then removing any non-shown text. Then, the words are counted. However, the process is not fully accurate.
